### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 Part 1 although being a quite simple program, I believe this lab was quite rudimentary to my knowledge of using the building blocks of code inside C++. This program simply assembled the condiments of a sandwich and permanently taught me that creating an efficiently flexible program to be important as constant combinantions and iterations would allow the output to be robust and accurate.
