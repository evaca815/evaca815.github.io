### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 Part 1 although being a quite simple program, I believe this lab was quite rudimentary to my knowledge of using the building blocks of code inside C++. This program simply assembled the condiments of a sandwich and permanently taught me that creating an efficiently flexible program to be important as constant combinantions and iterations would allow the output to be robust and accurate.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 Part 1 is definitely one of my all time favorite labs we worked on. This Lab intoduced the concept of the header file that basically served as the basic knowledge for a program to function. This Lab brought the capability of multiple programs and functions all utilizing one header file and in this specific instance, we calculated the area of a rectangle and would give an error message when insufficient information was provided.

* Lab 9

    In Lab 9 Part 1, I personally believe to be of large significance, as our goal was to create a program that would generate the average of judge scores for an olympic game. This not only used floating point numbers, numbers that also have a decimal value, but would also provide flexibility by still working regardless the amount of scores imputed by the user.
